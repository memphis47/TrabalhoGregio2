Mariane

I've been working all day
I've been thinking a lot
I've been doing some things
That are not quite right
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
When will you return?

I've been working all day
I've been thinking a lot
I've been lost in the morning
I don't know what it costs
Will you find me there?

And I guess it's just a phase
I don't know where I'm going
And I guess it's just a phase
I don't know where I'm going
And I guess it's just a phase
I don't know where I'm going
And I guess it's just a phase
I don't know where I'm going

I've been working all day
I've been thinking a lot
I've been lost in the morning
I don't know what it costs
I don't think about you
I will be able to do
Will you let me be?

And I don't know where I'm going
I guess it's just a phase
And I don't know where I'm going
I guess it's just a phase

And I don't know where I'm going
I guess it's just a phase
And I don't know where I'm going
I guess it's just a phase
